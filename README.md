My Senior Capstone project, a library of machine learning algorithms

KNNLibrary:
Uses Euclidean distance between data points to classify unknown points based on the classes of data points nearest to them

LinearRegression:
Fits a line, plane, or hyperplane to a set of data for predicting future data

NeuralNetwork:
In progress, adjusts connections between neuron data structures to predict probabilities
